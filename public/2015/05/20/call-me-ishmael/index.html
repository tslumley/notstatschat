      <p>Making small changes in text to escape plagiarism-detection software is challenging but not really difficult. The relationship between your text and the urtext in the software is precise and syntactic; the software doesn’t know about ideas. Making small changes in a text that change or obscure the meaning is also easy, and is why copyeditors exist. Making small changes in a text that give an interesting new meaning is enormously harder, as in the opening of Peter de Vries’ “The Vale of Laughter”, quoted as the title of this post.</p>
<p>A similar distinction connects two recent science stories.  A Berkeley-Montreal <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/drugs-regulate-home-brew-opiates-1.17563">biochemistry collaboration</a>  has made large steps towards GMO yeast that produces morphine. A US-German collaboration discovered a <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/infectious-thoughts/2015/01/08/will-new-antibiotic-teixobactin-save-us-all-umm-not-quite/">new candidate antibiotic, teixobactin</a>, and claimed it was resistant to antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Engineering yeast to produce morphine sounds like it should be easy. After all, morphine is a hugely simpler molecule than insulin, and recombinant insulin is older than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y.M.C.A._(song)">“Y.M.C.A”</a> or Space Invaders.  The distinction is that insulin is a protein, and morphine isn’t.</p>
<p>The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is that DNA is transcribed to RNA and translated to protein, and that (for protein-coding parts of the genome) this is a precise one-to-one copying process. Like all dogmas, this isn’t quite true — splicing matters, as does all the bling attached after translation (formally, post-translational modification). It’s still a good approximation. Making a protein such as insulin is almost as simple as sticking the insulin gene into a cell and running the transcription/translation program on it.</p>
<p>Morphine isn’t a protein. Proteins (enzymes) are the machinery that manufacture morphine. Getting a yeast cell to produce morphine means getting it to produce a whole series of enzymes, but that’s not enough. In order to produce morphine, this set of machinery must get assembled to a properly connected production line that takes in the right raw materials and spits out morphine at the end. That’s not easy.</p>
<p>Most targets of antibiotics are protein or RNA. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems target the penicillin-binding proteins that construct the bacterial cell wall. Macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, and tetracyclines attack the RNA/protein machinery of the ribosome. Fluoroquinolines such as Cipro block the protein DNA gyrase. Enzymes make good drug targets because the cell produces only small amounts; you don’t need much drug.  Teixobactin is an exception, as are the current last-resort antibiotic vancomycin and teicoplanin. These block the construction of cell walls as penicillin does, but bind to non-protein construction materials rather than protein machinery.  </p>
<p>To evolve resistance to antibiotics with protein targets, bacteria need to make lots of random changes to the proteins until they find a version that does pretty much the same job but doesn’t bind to the antibiotic. That was hard, but there are a lot of bacteria and they reproduce very fast, so we got MRSA.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin#Antibiotic_resistance">Resistance to vancomycin</a> took a lot longer to develop. A because a vancomycin-resistant germ has to find mutated versions of enzymes that do a <strong>different job</strong>. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci make a new enzyme that strips off one end of the target construction material and replaces it with a new piece that still works for cell wall construction but won’t bind to the antibiotic.</p>
<p>Proteins are incredibly complicated molecules. Morphine and vancomycin-resistance are much simpler, but they are new ideas for the cell rather than just edits to the same text. </p>
