I'm a statistical researcher in Auckland. This blog is for things that don't belong on my department's blog, [StatsChat](http://www.statschat.org.nz).  

I'm also on Bluesky [@tslumley](https://bsky.app/profile/tslumley.bsky.social) and I'm on Mastodon as [@tslumley@fediscience.org](https://fediscience.org/@tslumley).
