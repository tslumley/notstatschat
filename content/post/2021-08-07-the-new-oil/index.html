<p><em>Data is the New Oil</em> is a seriously underrated metaphor:</p>
<ul>
<li>started off as just a curiosity for nerds</li>
<li>creates new companies and industries and vastly improves the productivity of some existing ones</li>
<li>control over sources or extraction/transport infrastructure makes some individuals/companies/nations rich and powerful</li>
<li>this has absolutely no tendency to be good for their character and ethics</li>
<li>transporting and processing large quantities increases the risk of toxic leaks, which can cause a lot of local damage</li>
<li>when successfully used, produces exhaust products that are relatively harmless in small amounts but cumulatively dangerous</li>
<li>use becomes integrated into the economy and is hard for individuals to avoid</li>
<li>which is taken as consent by those who control the extraction and exploitation</li>
</ul>
