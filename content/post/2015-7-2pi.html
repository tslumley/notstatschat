<p>Pi day is celebrated on March 14 in all the countries that use the MM/DD/YYYY date format (ie, the USA). Pi Approximation day is celebrated in the rest of the world on July 22. </p>
<p>I’m proposing today for another one: π continued fraction day. Like the 22/7 festival it doesn’t depend on using base 10, and like American Pi day it is extensible when the stars align correctly. </p>
<p>The continued fraction expansion of π is<br />
<span class="math display">\[\pi=3+\frac{1}{7+\frac{1}{15+\frac{1}{292+\frac{1}{1+\cdots}}}}\]</span><br />
Taking just a initial segment of this gives the best possible rational expansions: 3, 22/7, 355/113,…</p>
<p>In most years, π continued fraction day will be 3:7, giving the approximation 22/7, slightly better than 3.14. This year, however, it’s 3:7,15, the continued fraction giving <span class="math inline">\(\pi\approx 355/113\)</span>, with an error of about <span class="math inline">\(2.7\times 10^{-7}\)</span>. That’s two orders of magnitude smaller than the error in 3.1415, and it’s even smaller than the error when the US celebrates Correctly-Rounded Pi Day next year, 3/14/16</p>
