<p>Two interesting examples from my e-bike:</p>
<p>The first is common in e-bikes. The charge indicator is a set of five little rectangles inside a battery outline, which makes sense. It’s very non-linear, though. The first little rectangle is almost half the battery charge.</p>

<p>When I mentioned this on Twitter some years ago the response was that lithium batteries are non-linear and there’s nothing that can be done about it. This superficially makes sense, until you think about it a bit. The indicator is not some magnets-and-wires pivoting-needle analogue voltmeter from the 1950s; it’s a digital display. Someone <em>chose</em> the cut-points on the voltage scale; someone <em>chose</em> the width of the little rectangles. The voltage-charge curve of a lithium battery isn’t a mystery, so there isn’t problem in having the indicator more linear. In fact, this particular bike comes with a range display that’s linear (in km) and reasonably accurate.</p>
<p>The second one is a display for the continuously-variable gear hub. This is cute but also quite clever – rather than using numbers or a ramp as in old volume controls, it shows a hill with a little cyclist person. As you adjust the gears, the hill changes in height and little cyclist person has more or less work to do</p>

<p>Obviously, when the hill is steep that means more work and so a higher gear. Or, obviously, when the hill is steep you would want a lower gear so the gear is lower. I know this is genuinely ambiguous, since the shop that repaired my old e-bike put the indicator in backwards!</p>
<p>This one doesn’t really matter, since I don’t actually look at the gear indicator and I just have to learn (as you do with any new bike) whether rolling your hand forward raises or lowers the gears.</p>
