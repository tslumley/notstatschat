<p>Again this week on the bus I passed the annoying <a href="http://www.phoenixorganics.co.nz/content/why-we-do-it/default.aspx">Phoenix Organics</a> delivery van that says <em>Don’t drink science, you don’t know where it’s been</em> [ Phoenix are also notable for their <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/bF9">aspartame scare page</a>. ]</p>
<p>One of the things they don’t write up as glowingly is that they add the synthetic version of a natural antioxidant to their <a href="http://www.phoenixorganics.co.nz/what-we-do/browse/organic-juices.aspx">juices</a> and their (naturally high-fructose) <a href="http://www.phoenixorganics.co.nz/what-we-do/browse/organic-sparkling-juice-drinks.aspx">juice drinks</a>, in unnaturally high concentrations. That’s perfectly legal by organic labelling rules, and the compound, ascorbic acid, is the same molecule as vitamin C – but we’re talking about an industry where ‘the same molecule’ doesn’t usually cut it as an excuse. </p>
<p>And it’s not just that the ascorbic acid is synthetic. Almost all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C#Industrial_synthesis">commercial vitamin C</a> is made by Chinese chemical companies,with just one <a href="http://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html">Scottish chemical company</a> remaining in competition. Again, that’s not something I have a problem with, but customers of Phoenix Organics might well feel differently if they knew.</p>
