<p>Q: There have been a lot of papers recently about the spike in p-values just below 0.05, haven’t there?</p>
<p>A: Yes. A bit depressing. But there’s a new analysis that says it’s ok.</p>
<p>Q: Really? That’s great!</p>
<p>A: Yes, <a href="http://daniellakens.blogspot.nl/2015/02/a-peculiar-surge-of-incorrect.html?m=1">Daniel Lakens shows</a> that you can explain the recent increase in just-significant p-values, and that <em>“data does not provide any indication of an increase in questionable research practices”</em></p>
<p>Q: And is his modelling correct?</p>
<p>A: It certainly looks plausible.</p>
<p>Q: So what does explain the 0.04 spike, if it’s not ‘questionable research practices’</p>
<p>A: Let’s see…Ah. A decrease in power and increase in publication bias.</p>

<p>Q: Sorry, I got nothing.</p>
