<p>In New Zealand, ‘radiata’ and ‘macrocarpa’ are accepted common names for two widely planted non-native conifers: <em>Pinus radiata</em> and <em>Cupressus macrocarpa,</em> known in their native US as ‘Monterey pine’ and ‘Monterey cypress’ respectively.</p>
<p>It’s unusual for the specific epithet of a plant to become the common name. There are plenty of examples of the generic name becoming the common name, from ‘bougainvillea’ to ‘wisteria’.  There are even plenty of examples where a former generic name has stuck as the common name after the botanists have renamed the plant to, eg,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelargonium"><em>Pelargonium</em></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippeastrum"><em>Hippeastrum</em></a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corymbia"><em>Corymbia</em></a>. </p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever heard another example of the specific name working this way, and I only know of one other example.  Henry Reed’s famous poem <a href="http://www.solearabiantree.net/namingofparts/namingofparts.html"><em>Naming of Parts</em></a> mentions ‘japonica’, which turns out to be the flowering quince <em>Chaenomeles japonica,</em> and by extension, other species and hybrids of <em>Chaenomeles</em>. </p>
<p>Are there others?</p>
