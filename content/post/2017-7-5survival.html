<p><strong>Tuesday 12 and Wednesday 13 September 2017, 9am-5pm. </strong>This two-day workshop will cover data exploration, data summaries, and regression modelling for time-to-event data.  There will be both lecture and practical sessions.</p>
<p>Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concepts: censoring, truncation, competing risks, choice of time scale</p></li>
<li>Summaries: the Kaplan–Meier curve; mean, median, and proportion surviving; the hazard rate; graphical exploration</li>
<li>Two-sample testing: the logrank test and its strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li><p>The proportional  hazards model: right censoring, left truncation, </p></li>
<li><p>Time-varying predictors</p></li>
<li><p>Modelling recurrent events</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, I’m aiming to target the issues that make time-to-event data different from more familiar binary or continuous data. Most of the examples will be medical, but the same issues exist in engineering and in the social sciences.</p>
<p>Participants should be familiar with linear and logistic regression, and should bring a laptop with suitable statistical software. R is preferred, but assistance will probably be available with Stata and SAS.</p>
