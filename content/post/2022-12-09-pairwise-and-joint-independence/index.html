<p>It’s intuitively plausible that pairwise independence of a set of variables implies joint independence. Sadly, it’s not true. Not everyone seems to know my favourite simple example, a chessboard:

<p>If you pick a point uniformly at random from the chessboard (or just pick a square uniformly at random), the row, column, and colour are pairwise independent. The row and column are independent because of uniform sampling; in any row, the colour is independent of the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate; in any column, the colour is independent of the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate. However, the row and column together completely determine the colour, so we don’t have joint independence.</p>
<p>It’s fairly common to see what’s effectively a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> version of this example: <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> independent binary variables and <span class="math inline">\(Z= I(X \neq Y)\)</span>. I think the chessboard is better, because chessboards are actually a thing that many people have encountered in real life.</p>
<p>The chessboard generalises to higher dimensions, in a way that is no long familiar from real life but I think is still relatively easy to imagine. If you have alternating black and white cubes stacked into a big cube, and you pick a point uniformly at random, any three of the row, column, layer, and colour are independent, but not all four.</p>
