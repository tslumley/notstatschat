<p>Scientists have a nasty habit of taking ordinary English words, turning them into technical terms, and then insisting that the ordinary use is Just Wrong. ‘Organic’, which I’ve written about before, is a good example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes the scientists are right. I complained on Twitter last night about the phrase <em>‘meningococcal virus’</em> in a Herald <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=11347878">opinion piece</a> on state housing, and I have previously complained about the ‘Psa virus’  for the bacterium <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> pv. <em>actinidiae. </em></p>
<p>I checked the Oxford English Dictionary, which reports a general meaning of ‘virus’, but says it’s out of date</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a. Med. Originally: pus or other discharge produced by an ulcer or wound. Later: a substance produced within the body by a disease, esp. when contagious or infectious or used for vaccination; (also) any agent causing an infectious disease. Now hist. except in the restricted sense 2b.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the OED to decide a usage is <em>hist.</em>, it’s got to really be <em>hist.</em> It’s not just sleeping; it’s an ex-usage. </p>
<p>The distinction between viruses and bacteria seems to have become part of English in the 1940s, about the time antibiotics were becoming available. That’s probably no coincidence: antibiotics kill bacteria but not viruses, they cure scarlet fever but not measles, so they made the bacteria/virus distinction relevant to everyone. </p>
<p>Antibiotics are the reason the distinction is even more important today. New Zealand has a problem of both underuse and overuse of antibiotics. Some kids aren’t getting penicillin for strep throat, and a few of them end up with rheumatic fever. On the other hand, some people are still getting antibiotics for viral infections or other situations where they are not helpful. </p>
<p>‘Meningococcal virus’ is a particularly unfortunate confusion: meningococci are bacteria, and antibiotic treatment is a matter of the greatest possible urgency in suspected meningococcal disease. </p>
