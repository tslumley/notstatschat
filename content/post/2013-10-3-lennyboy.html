<p><em>Background: The Herald has had a whole <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11133832">sequence</a> of <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11134384">stories</a>, including two on the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11133160">front</a> <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11133907">page</a>, about the decision of the city council to stop mowing the ‘berms’, the strips of grass between the road and sidewalk. </em></p>
<p><em>Additional background: the Mayor of Auckland is one Len Brown</em>.</p>
<p>O Lenny Boy, the berms, the berms need mowing<br />
From Glen to Lynn, and down Mt Eden side<br />
The winter’s gone, and all the grass is growing<br />
’Tis you, ’tis you must mow, and let us bide</p>
<p>And come ye back, at two or three week intervals<br />
Or when the weeds and clover start to show<br />
The grass will grow, in sunshine or in shadow<br />
O Lenny Boy, we pay our rates, and you must mow</p>
