<p>They’re back, again.</p>
<p>For the 2024 Ihaka Lectures we have</p>
<ul>
<li>12 September: Yihui, who <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=yihui">needs no introduction</a>, on <em>Reimagining literate programming and automated report generation</em></li>
<li>19 September: Farah Hancock, a data journalist. <em>Initially trained as a designer, Farah Hancock worked for many years in the advertising industry in New Zealand and abroad, primarily working on digital campaigns. Experiencing a midlife career crisis she pivoted to journalism and as a visual thinker she inadvertently fell into data journalism when the Covid-19 pandemic started. Since then she’s visualised a range of topics from food exports to bus cancellations, fatal police shootings and political donations.</em></li>
<li>26 September: Peter Ellis, formerly a data scientist in the NZ public service and now Director of the Statistics for Development division at the Pacific Community. Peter will talk about <em>Making R work in Government</em> and notes that “R’s competitor in government is not Julia or Python or even SAS, but overwhelmingly Excel.”</li>
</ul>
