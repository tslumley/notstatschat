<p>Q: What do you mean, “reboot”? Like, a new e-bike with only a vague brand-name resemblance to the original?</p>
<p>A: Pretty much. I’m 200km into a SmartMotion Pacer GT.</p>
<p>Q: How fast does it go?</p>
<p>A: Haven’t we talked about that question?</p>
<p>Q:</p>
<p>A: Ok. It’s faster than the old one, because it has a wider range of gears. I get up to 45km/h down Manukau Rd toward Royal Oak. Which is actually faster than I’m happy going on Auckland roads.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you get a new e-bike when you had a perfectly good old one?</p>
<p>A: Partly the gears thing. Also, I tried one with a torque sensor when I was on holiday in Melbourne, and I liked it.</p>
<p>Q: What’s a torque sensor?</p>
<p>A: Well, when I first started riding my old e-bike, I thought <em>“Someone needs to invent a version of this with a strain gauge on the pedals, to measure effort rather than speed”</em>. They did. It’s faster <em>and</em> you get more exercise, because there’s more return to pedalling harder than there is with a cadence sensor.</p>
<p>Q: What other features does it have?</p>
<p>A: Built-in lights, bright enough that they don’t need to be flashing. A speedometer, so I know I’m going at the speed limit when cars are tailgating me down Lower Domain Drive. And a continuously variable transmission.</p>
<p>Q: A continuously what?</p>
<p>A: <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/how-a-bike-with-infinite-gears-changed-the-way-i-commute/">Infinite gears?</a>. The gear ratio changes smoothly as you turn the handle. It’s a gimmick, but it’s a nice one. You get the advantages (and disadvantages) of hub gears, to a higher level.</p>
<p>Q: That sounds expensive.</p>
<p>A: Yes. But there was a discount because a new higher-power version is supposed to be coming out soon. Since I don’t care about higher power that was a good opportunity. It probably won’t be cheaper than taking the bus, over its lifetime. But it won’t be <em>much</em> more expensive.</p>
<p>Q: What about a throttle?</p>
<p>A: I do miss that from the old one. The torque sensor gives you good acceleration starting up, but it doesn’t kick in as fast – which matters, eg, for traffic lights heading up hill. There is a throttle on the new one, but it’s a bit Keynesian – it operates with long and variable lags. I should get it checked to see if it’s broken.</p>
