 Q: There have been a lot of papers recently about the spike in p-values just below 0.05, haven't there?

A: Yes. A bit depressing. But there's a new analysis that says it's ok.

Q: Really? That's great!

A: Yes, [Daniel Lakens shows](http://daniellakens.blogspot.nl/2015/02/a-peculiar-surge-of-incorrect.html?m=1) that you can explain the recent increase in just-significant p-values, and that _"data does not provide any indication of an increase in questionable research practices"_

Q: And is his modelling correct?

A: It certainly looks plausible.

Q: So what does explain the 0.04 spike, if it's not 'questionable research practices'

A: Let's see...Ah. A decrease in power and increase in publication bias.
