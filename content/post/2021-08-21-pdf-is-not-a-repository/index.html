<p>We’re in Covid lockdown again in Auckland, and it’s a weekend, so I happened to be on the Stats stackoverflow site.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Someone was trying to use R to check MLE calculations for a few papers that propose new parametric models – the “overgeneralised Gamma distribution” genre of statistical literature. These paper typically have “real data sets”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which might provide a good introduction to optimisation problems that are a bit harder than generalised linear models but don’t require any specialised knowledge.</p>
<p>The first example looks to be just wrong. The data were on the failure times of fifty “components”, not further specified; the distribution was a new modified half-logistic distribution with two extra shape parameters. The person asking the question worked out the MLE, and I duplicated his answer and also worked it out a different way. We got the same result, with higher loglikelihood than the estimate in the paper. I suspected a typo in the data, but it matches the textbook it was taken from. Who knows – or, really, cares?</p>
<p>The second example actually gave R code, which is a big step forward. There were two problems with it, though. Here’s what the code looked like</p>

<p>I spent quite a while trying to get this to work. One potential issue I thought of was numerical instability, so I simplified the log(power) terms and used <code>log1p</code> to handle the <code>log(1+)</code> terms. Weirdly, the result didn’t change after some of my edits.</p>
<p>A function body in R consists of multiple <code>call</code> objects. These are evaluated in turn, and the value of the function is the value of the last call. The body of this function, specifically, consists of three <code>call</code> objects. The value of the function is the value of the last of the three: <code>-2 * sum(log(1 + (log((1 + x/beta)^alpha))^(-lambda)))</code>, just a fragment of the actual loglikelihood. You’d never have this problem with <em>real code</em>, but it’s easy with PDF or paper pictures of code. Either copy-pasting or retyping the code is likely to be wrong even without the potential for typos. PDF is not a code format; paper isn’t either. I’ve seen worse than this: a paper in JRSS A where the online appendix had code <strong>in a bitmap image</strong>.</p>
<p>Oh, the second problem? The code calls <code>mle2</code>, which expects to be given the negative loglikelihood, and so minimises it. The function <code>ll_LLx</code>, however, is the loglikelihood. So the code, if you fix the spurious line breaks to make it run as it putatively did for the authors, would give a minimum likelihood estimator. Fixing this second problem finally gives the answers in the paper, demonstrating that the authors <strong>did not</strong> get them from the code they provided.</p>
