  _Background: The Herald has had a whole [sequence](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11133832) of [stories](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11134384), including two on the [front](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11133160) [page](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11133907), about the decision of the city council to stop mowing the 'berms', the strips of grass between the road and sidewalk.Â _

_Additional background: the Mayor of Auckland is one Len Brown_.

O Lenny Boy, the berms, the berms need mowing  
From Glen to Lynn, and down Mt Eden side  
The winter's gone, and all the grass is growing  
'Tis you, 'tis you must mow, and let us bide

And come ye back, at two or three week intervals  
Or when the weeds and clover start to show  
The grass will grow, in sunshine or in shadow  
O Lenny Boy, we pay our rates, and you must mow
