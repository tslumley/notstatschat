Anchoring bias: high school students asked to add up the digits in their phone number and to estimate how many countries there are in Africa.

(phew, it worked)

(I did delete one data point as non-responsive: estimated number of countries in Africa was 1)

(with adults I'd use last two digits of phone number, but with teenage girls I thought a bit more information-hiding was appropriate)
