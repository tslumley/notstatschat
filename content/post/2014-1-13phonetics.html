<p>There are two* great commandments for conference session chairs</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You shall adhere to the schedule with all your heart and all your mind and all your strength</li>
<li>You shall pronounce the speakers’ names approximately as they do themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>For show-biz award ceremonies the first commandment doesn’t apply, but the second <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/2015-golden-globes-ricky-gervais-mispronounces-quvenzhane-walliss/story?id=28157683">still does</a>.</p>
<p>In order to pronounce someone’s name correctly, you need to ask for the correct pronunciation and have some way of remembering it, such as writing it down phonetically.  </p>
<p>Asking is necessary – either asking the speaker, or in the case of someone famous, perhaps asking one of her friends or colleagues.  The problem isn’t so much with straightforward names such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einojuhani_Rautavaara">Einojuhani Rautavaara</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahela_Jayawardene">Mahela Jayawardene</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_I">Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i Kaiwikapu kauʻi Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea</a>. These  you could maybe work out on your own, with a bit of time for research. The problem is names like MacKay (/mɨ’kai/ or /mə’kei/) and Cai (/kai/ or /tsʰai/) that are genuinely ambiguous. </p>
<p>*and for the Joint Statistical Meetings, the third great commandment: you shall not chair any other session at the meeting, even in an emergency.</p>
