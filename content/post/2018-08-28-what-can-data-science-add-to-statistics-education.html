<p><em>(for Deborah Nolan and Louise Ryan, ISCB/ASC 2018, after Henry Reed)</em></p>
<p>Today we have naming of stats. Yesterday<br> We had assumptions. And tomorrow morning<br> We shall have testing of assumptions. But to-day<br> Today we have naming of stats. <em>Data</em><br> <em>sparkles and flashes through all of the students’ phones.</em><br> <em>And today we have naming of stats.</em></p>
<p>This is the rank-sum Wilcoxon test. And this<br> is the one-sample Wilcoxon test, whose use you see<br> when you are given one sample. And this is Levene’s test<br> Which in your case you have not got. <em>Near-supercomputers idle</em><br> <em>in pockets and desks, waiting for questions</em><br> <em>Which in our case we have not got.</em><br></p>
<p>This is the t-test, which is always performed<br> with assumptions of unequal variance. Do not let me<br> see anyone with equal variances. You can easily do it<br> with the formulas back of the book. <em>Global temperatures</em><br> <em>dance in rising spirals, not letting any one see them with equal variances.</em><br></p>
<p>And this you can see is the list. The purpose of this is to<br> teach to the test, as you see. We can keep it constant from year to year.<br> We say this provides transparency. <em>And constant from year to year</em><br> <em>Bored students stare out of the window. They say it provides transparency.</em><br></p>
<p><em>They say it provides transparency: you can easily do it</em><br> <em>with the formulas back of the book: like the list,and the test,</em><br> <em>and the context, which in our case we have not got;</em><br> <em>and the temperatures rising and the data and science and questions</em><br> <em>constant from year to year. For today we have naming of stats.</em><br></p>
