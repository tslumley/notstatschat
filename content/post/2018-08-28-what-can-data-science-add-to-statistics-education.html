<p><em>(for Deborah Nolan and Louise Ryan, ISCB/ASC 2018)</em></p>
<p>Today we have naming of stats. Yesterday We had assumptions. And tomorrow morning We shall have testing of assumptions. But to-day Today we have naming of stats. <em>Data</em> <em>sparkles and flashes through all of the students’ phones.</em> <em>And today we have naming of stats.</em></p>
<p>This is the rank-sum Wilcoxon test. And this is the one-sample Wilcoxon test, whose use you see when you are given one sample. And this is Levene’s test Which in your case you have not got. <em>Near-supercomputers idle</em> <em>in pockets and desks, waiting for questions</em> <em>Which in our case we have not got.</em></p>
<p>This is the t-test, which is always performed with assumptions of unequal variance. Do not let me see anyone with equal variances. You can easily do it with the formulas back of the book. <em>Global temperatures</em> <em>dance in rising spirals, not letting any one see them with equal variances.</em></p>
<p>And this you can see is the list. The purpose of this is to teach to the test, as you see. We can keep it constant from year to year. We say this provides transparency. <em>And constant from year to year</em> <em>Bored students stare out of the window. They say it provides transparency.</em></p>
<p><em>They say it provides transparency: you can easily do it</em> <em>with the formulas back of the book: like the list,and the test,</em> <em>and the context, which in our case we have not got;</em> <em>and the temperatures rising and the data and science and questions</em> <em>constant from year to year. For today we have naming of stats.</em></p>
