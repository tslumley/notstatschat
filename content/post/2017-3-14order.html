<p>Over the years when I was intermittently working on the rock-paper-scissors (transitivity) problem in statistical testing, one of the confusing things was the difference between order and quotient topologies. I thought I’d write about why.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two-dimensional Euclidean space, with points <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>, and you decide to order points on the first coordinate, so <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\prec(z,w)\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;z\)</span>. This gives you equivalence classes <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\sim(z,w)\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x=z\)</span>.  There are two obvious topologies on the set of equivalence classes. </p>
<p>The first is the quotient topology, where you just collapse each equivalence class to a point. The function doing the collapsing is <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x,y)=x\)</span> and we define a set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of equivalence classes as open if there is an open set <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> in the two-d space with <span class="math inline">\(V=\phi(U)\)</span>. Thinking heuristically in terms of metrics, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are close in the quotient space if there are points <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((z,w)\)</span> that are close in the original two-d space.  The quotient topology depends on the original topological structure, but not on the ordering. </p>
<p>The second topology is the order topology, where the open sets of equivalence classes are generated by the open intervals in the ordering: <span class="math inline">\((a,b)=\{x: a\prec x\prec b\}\)</span>.  This uses the ordering but not the original topological structure.</p>
<p>In the two-dimensional to one-dimensional example these are the same: they both give the standard topology on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.  This happens in a lot of examples, so it’s easy to confuse the two. In particular, it happens when the equivalence classes are a stack of nice tidy surfaces that cut across a finite-dimensional space. Since that was my mental picture of what’s going on, I didn’t realise there could even be a problem. [Update: Debreu’s Theorem, in economics, is a more sophisticated version of this picture]</p>
<p> An example where the topologies are very different is when you start with cumulative distribution functions under the supremum metric and you order by the mean.  If <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a cdf with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> there are cdfs with any other mean <span class="math inline">\(\\nu\)</span> arbitrarily close to <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in the original metric.  The quotient topology isn’t any use for studying the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.  The order toplogy, though, is still the ordinary topology on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. </p>
