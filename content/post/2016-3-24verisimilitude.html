<p>Scene: the back room of a gas station not far from a Research 1 university, late twentieth century. </p>
<p>“Chris? You got a minute”</p>
<p>It’s Chris’s ‘lunch’ break, which by natural justice and state law should be the time for daydreaming about attractive members of the appropriate sex while trying to start an assignment on Banach spaces. </p>
<p>“The boss read an in-flight magazine again” </p>
<p>Chris sighs. Having the owner away for a week was good, but he always seemed to get…ideas</p>
<p>“He says we need visual analytics to optimize our product mix. Yeah, yeah, I know, we’re a gas station. We sell regular and premium. We don’t even got diesel. You’re studying analytics, right?”</p>
<p>“Not analytics, analysis. It’s … no, ok… what do you need?”</p>
<p>“A graph. Number of gallons, Total cost. Then use analysis to work out the price”</p>
<p>“But we know the price! It’s on the sign, in large friendly letters. You just made me change it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, whatever. He wants a graph, we give him a graph. He’s paying a bonus for it.”</p>
<p>“That’s different. Ok. You got graph paper”</p>
<p>“Graph paper?”</p>
<p>“You know, blue ink, little squares?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that stuff. My kids have some. Maybe I could get Sandy to do it?”</p>
<p>Chris saw the bonus slipping away.</p>
<p>“We got anything with squares?”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s the grid that Pat uses for D&amp;D layouts, Would that..”</p>
<p>“Perfect. Just give me a few minutes. He’ll have the best-fitting line graph ever seen in the industry”</p>
<p>“You want help with measuring?”</p>
<p> “I’m not wasting time measuring. Like I said, we know the price.”</p>
