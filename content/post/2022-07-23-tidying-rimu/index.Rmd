I've been working on the `rimu` package recently, which handles multiple-response categorical data. This has involved miscellaneous fixing, but also getting these new types to work happily with data frames, in preparation for the `rata` package that will support  modelling and inference^[If you have ideas about modelling and inference that you want it to support, now would be an excellent time to voice them]. 

For example, consider this little six-observation pretend dataset:

```{r}
library(rimu)
data(nzbirds)
seen <- as.mr(nzbirds)
seen
str(seen)
```

The print method for the `mr` object prints the birds that were observed in each record. The `?` indicates an `NA`: record number 6 isn't clear on whether a [ruru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morepork) was seen. 

The underlying representation, however, is a logical matrix with an attribute specifying which bird corresponds to each column.  If you just try to put a matrix object into a data frame, it decays to the matrix and you end up with a 5-column data frame. That's ugly. More importantly, there's nothing to keep those five columns together in further data processing

```{r}
data.frame(as.matrix(seen))
```

One of the features of a data frame is that it can hold a wide variety of object types -- but it's tricky to get it to hold multi-column types.  What I did was to borrow Terry Therneau's solution for the `Surv` objects in the `survival` package. These are two-column or three-column matrices that mostly look and behave like simple vectors. I must once have known how this all worked, but it has been about 25 years since I did the initial port of the package to R. Looking the code again, it looks like overriding the `length` method to give the number of observations and the `names` method to give row names, and the `as.data.frame` method will keep the object in a single column of the data frame.  Here's a test example with a temporary class

```{r}
seen2<-as.matrix(seen)
class(seen2)<-"tmp"
length.tmp <- function(x) nrow(x)
names.tmp <- function(x) rownames(x)
as.data.frame.tmp <- function(x, ...) as.data.frame.model.matrix(x, ...)
dim(data.frame(birds=seen2))
```

It still displays as a binary matrix: 

```{r}
data.frame(birds=seen2)
```

Writing a `format` method fixes that, too. It's a bit of a pain to write one for the temporary class, but the one for the real class is just
```{r}
rimu:::format.mr
```

and it works

```{r}
data.frame(birds=seen)
```

Let's look at a slightly less trivial example, with data from the RStudio Community Survey. One of the questions is about other software used, presented as a comma-and-space-separated list. 

```{r}
data(rstudiosurvey)
names(rstudiosurvey)[40]
## Other software being used
head(rstudiosurvey[[40]])
```

The `as.mr` method for strings breaks the string at the specified separator and sets up a multiple-response object; `mtable` does tables that count all the responses.

```{r}
other_software<- as.mr(rstudiosurvey[[40]], sep=", ")
## only those with at least 20 responses
common<-mr_lump(other_software, n=20)
mtable(common)
## 'None' isn't really another package
common<-mr_drop(common, "None")
mtable(common)
```


Another question asked how happy people were using R, on a 1-5 scale

```{r}
names(rstudiosurvey)[18]
happy<-factor(rstudiosurvey[[18]])
mtable(happy, common)
round(prop.table(mtable(happy,common),2),2)
```

And here's a little data frame
```{r}
timestamp<-as.Date(rstudiosurvey[[1]],format="%m/%d/%y")
df<-data.frame(timestamp, happy, common)
dim(df)
head(df)
```

But does this work for tibbles? 

```{r}
library(tibble)
tibble(birds=seen)
```

ðŸ’©

Tibbles have their own rendering system.  If you try to explore it from the command line, you will find yourself in a maze of twisty little methods, all different.  But there's the [`vctrs` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vctrs/vignettes/s3-vector.html) to create new vector types.

Multiple-response objects don't map neatly on to any of the existing `vctrs` examples.  There are multi-column types, such as the `rational` and `decimal2` examples at that link, but these have the same number of component columns for every instance of the type. There are list-of-vectors types, such as the polynomial example at that link, but these have potentially varying numbers of elements for every item in a vector.  The multiple-response objects have the same 'width' for every item in a vector -- five, for the birds; twenty for the common software packages -- but different multiple response objects have different widths.  

I settled for the list-of-vectors approach. It will be relatively inefficient to do column operations with this representation, but that's a problem for the future. Slightly more problematically, the list representation doesn't straightforwardly allow `NA` values. 

Following the polynomial example, we get 

```{r}
library(vctrs)
library(rimu)

new_vmr <- function(x,levels=unique(do.call(c,x))) {
  new_list_of(x, ptype = character(), class = "vmr", levs=levels)
}

as.vmr<-function(x,...) UseMethod("as.vmr")
as.vmr.mr<-function(x,...) {
    l<-levels(x)
    y<-lapply(apply(x,1,c, simplify=FALSE), function(i) l[as.logical(i)])
    new_vmr(y,l)
}
as.vmr.default<-function(x,...) as.vmr(as.mr(x,...))

vec_ptype_full.vmr <- function(x, ...) "vmr"
vec_ptype_abbr.vmr <- function(x, ...) "vmr"

format.vmr <- function(x, ...) {
    format(as.mr(unclass(x),...,levels=attr(x,"levs")))
}

obj_print_data.vmr <- function(x, ...) {
  if (length(x) == 0)
    return()
  print(format(x), quote = FALSE)
}
```

Now to test this -- remembering to drop the `NA` value for ruru:

```{r}
v_seen<- as.vmr(mr_na(seen,FALSE))
v_seen

test<-tibble(birbs=v_seen, id=1:6,count=mr_count(seen))
dim(test)
test
```

Everything mostly works -- but inside the tibble, the object prints in  a weird shorthand that turns out to be the length of the vector for that row. This is a bit confusing, because the `vctrs` vignette says *The format method is also used by data frames, tibbles, and str()*.  After a while trying to find the code that actually did the formatting, it occurred to me to try the polynomial example that the vignette provides.  It also prints as `[2]`, etc, rather than calling the `format` method.  So this is what's supposed to be happening.

There's a [separate vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vctrs/vignettes/pillar.html) on how to complicate the printing of tibbles with the `pillar` package. Following that, we can try

```{r}
library(pillar)
 pillar_shaft.vmr<-function (x, ...) {
     out <- style_subtle(format(x))
    new_pillar_shaft_simple(out, align = "right")
 }
```

which works

```{r}
test
```

One more refinement: `vctrs` allows for full-width and abbreviated printing, and this printing format can get pretty wide, so I tried also defining an abbreviated format that's just the binary values pasted together

```{r}
pillar_shaft.vmr <- function(x, ...) {
  full <- format(x)
  binary <- apply(as.matrix(as.mr(x)),1, paste0,collapse="")

  pillar::new_pillar_shaft(
    list(full = full, binary =binary),
    width = pillar::get_max_extent(full),
    min_width = pillar::get_max_extent(binary),
    class = "pillar_shaft_vmr"
  )
}


format.pillar_shaft_vmr <- function(x, width, ...) {
  if (get_max_extent(x$full) <= width) {
    ornament <- x$full
  } else {
    ornament <- x$binary
  }

  pillar::new_ornament(ornament, align = "right")
}
```

And it works. 

```{r}
tibble(birbs=v_seen, more_birbs=v_seen,
       yet_more_birbs=v_seen, 
       all_the_birbs=v_seen, 
       will_it_never_end=v_seen)
```

I'm still not sure what I want for an abbreviated printout, but at least it can be done. We have a `vctrs` class, and one that's a bit different from the existing examples. There's still an issue with `NA` entries, but that should be fixable somehow.
