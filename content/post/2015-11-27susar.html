<p>This is a flow-chart I put together, that may go in the documentation for the Health Research Council data monitoring committee. Obviously the questions in boxes are simplified and would need expansion in the text.</p>

<p>Most of the work of the data monitoring committee, and the work that the study does on our behalf, is concentrated at the twice-yearly meetings. Some things, though, can’t safely be left to accumulate for six months, so there’s urgent reporting of sufficiently noteworthy clinical events to a clinician on the data monitoring committee.</p>
<p>SUSAR stands for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction; you can see why we use the acronym. A SUSAR means: a <strong>Seriously Adverse</strong> thing happened to someone; there was some reason to attribute it to the treatment, so it’s a <strong>Suspected</strong> <strong>Reaction</strong>; and it was <strong>Unexpected</strong>, so participants weren’t warned about the possibility before giving consent.</p>
<p>It’s pretty standard around the world that SUSARs are reported urgently. The problem with just doing this with SUSARs is that the Suspected and Unexpected aspects are a bit subjective. For example, it might be that the severity is Unexpected, even though qualitatively the Adverse Reaction is Expected. Or it might be that the trial investigators don’t Suspect a connection to treatment, but a more paranoid person might.  For that reason, it’s reasonably common for all Serious Adverse Events to be reported urgently, even if they aren’t Unexpected or aren’t Suspected Reactions.  </p>
