<p>I don’t normally explain jokes, but it’s clear from the useR conference that the name of the new R package <code>reticulate</code> divides people into two groups: amused or bemused.</p>
<p>The word <em>reticulate</em> barely exists in modern English. It comes from the Latin <em>reticulum</em>, ‘small net’, the diminutive of <em>rete</em>, net. In NZ and Australian usage, mains water – supplied by a network of pipes – is called a ‘reticulated water supply.’ There are also scientific and artistic uses referring to a netted appearance – in stone, in plant leaves, in insect wings, and (most relevantly) in the scale markings of <em>Python reticulatus</em>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python">reticulated python</a>.</p>
<p>So, <code>reticulate</code> is a Python interface package for R – with the additional suggestion of being a copy of Python caught in a net inside R.</p>
