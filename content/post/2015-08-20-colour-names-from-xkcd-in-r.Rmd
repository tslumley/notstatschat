Randall Munroe at XKCD did a color names survey a few years ago, and [published a list](http://xkcd.com/color/rgb.txt) of about a thousand colour names whose RGB values (averaged across his readers’ monitors) could be fairly reliably estimated.

I have finally got around to turning them into [an R package](https://github.com/tslumley/xkcdcolors). It’s only on GitHub so far. The functions are

*  `xcolors(max_rank=-1)`: List the top (most commonly given) max\_rank color names; analogous to colors()  
    
*   `name2color(name, exact = TRUE, hex_only = TRUE, n = -1)`: Find colours exactly or partly matching a given name, reporting just the hex color string or the full data, optionally only using the top n colours.
*   `nearest_named(color, hex_only = FALSE, max_rank = -1, Lab = TRUE)`: given a matrix of RGB or a vector of color hex strings, report the nearest colours with names, optionally restricting to the top n colors, and using either Lab or R’s RGB colour space to define ‘nearest’. 

For example, the nearest named colors to the standard palette are 

```
> [1] "black"           "fire engine red" "vibrant green"   "primary blue"    
> [5] "cyan"            "bright magenta"  "bright yellow"   "silver"          
```

Restricted to the top 100 colours they are

```
> [1] "black"         "red"           "green"         "violet"        "cyan"          
> [6] "bright purple" "yellow"        "grey"          
```

The picture at the top of this post shows the ColorBrewer “Dark2″ palette, with the nearest named colors in both RGB and Lab space.
