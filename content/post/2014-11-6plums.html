<p><em>The plums, which you stored there on ice,</em><br />
<em>I have eaten; they went in a trice.</em><br />
<em>If you meant them to last</em><br />
<em>For a morning repast</em><br />
<em>Then I’m sorry, but boy were they nice.</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>Some say the plums will end in tarts</em><br />
<em>Some say on ice</em><br />
<em>From what I’ve eaten ’round these parts</em><br />
<em>I hold with those who favor tarts</em><br />
<em>But if they had to vanish first</em><br />
<em>I think I know enough of guilt</em><br />
<em>To say that for consumption, chilled</em><br />
<em>is also good, and would suffice</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>Plums by here, my dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>plums by here, my dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>plums by here, my dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>In the icebox, plums by here</em></p>
<p><em>Someone’s hungry, dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>Someone’s hungry, dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>Someone’s hungry, dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>In the icebox, plums by here</em></p>
<p><em>Cold and sweet, my dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>Cold and sweet, my dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>Cold and sweet, my dear, plums by here</em><br />
<em>In the icebox, plums by here</em></p>
<p><em>Someone’s sorry, dear, no plums here</em><br />
<em>Someone’s sorry, dear, no plums here</em><br />
<em>Someone’s sorry, dear, no plums here</em><br />
<em>No breakfast, no plums here</em></p>
