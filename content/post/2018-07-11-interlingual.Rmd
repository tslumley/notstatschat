I don't normally explain jokes, but it's clear from the useR conference that the name of the new R package
`reticulate` divides people into two groups: amused or bemused. 

The word *reticulate* barely exists in modern English. It comes from the Latin *reticulum*, 
'small net', the diminutive of *rete*, net. In NZ and Australian usage, mains water -- supplied by 
a network of pipes -- is called a 'reticulated water supply.' There are also scientific and 
artistic uses referring to a netted appearance -- in stone, in plant leaves, in insect wings,
and (most relevantly) in the scale markings of *Python reticulatus*, the
[reticulated python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python). 

So, `reticulate` is a Python interface package for R -- with the additional suggestion of
being a copy of Python caught in a net inside R.
