<p>There was a <a href="http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/quake/2016/11/14/M7.5+Kaikoura+Quake%3A+What+we+know+so+far">pair of big earthquakes</a> in New Zealand last night (late Sunday morning UTC, just after midnight Monday NZ time). They were about half-way between Wellington and Canterbury, in the northeast of the South Island. There have been a lot of smaller related quakes <a href="https://twitter.com/kamal_hothi/status/797921821630705664">as well</a>.</p>
<p>Auckland and Dunedin are unharmed. </p>
<p>Christchurch was shaken but not seriously damaged; some people were evacuated because of the potential for a big tsunami.</p>
<p>There is damage in Wellington, especially in the central business district, exacerbated by even more rain and wind than is usual. Wellington is also worried about aftershocks.</p>
<p>Closer to the quakes, damage is severe. Buildings were destroyed, with two deaths being reported.  The main road and rail line along the coast are broken in multiple places; they aren’t coming back soon.  </p>
<p>Over a much wider area of the country, bridges, rail lines, and water supplies are being checked (a lot of NZ runs on untreated groundwater). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/">Radio NZ</a> is the place to go for more information. </p>
<p>(And here’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/radionz/status/797999347413590017">snippet of the midnight news broadcast</a> from Wellington as the quake happened)</p>
