<p>Suppose you could make the following observations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ling (零) was a pianist</li>
<li>Every pianist has a favourite student</li>
<li>Different pianists have different favourite students</li>
<li>Ling was not the favourite student of any pianist<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Anything that Ling knew and that every pianist teaches to his favourite student ends up known by everyone in the Ling School of Piano (it’s like martial arts)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the first three observations continue to be true, the Ling School of Piano will obviously go on forever. From all five, you can deduce a lot of mathematical results about it, starting with most of arithmetic . Piano arithmetic turns out to be just the same as ordinary arithmetic<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you make these observations (per Dennett)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I am a mammal</p></li>
<li><p>The mother of every mammal is a mammal<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>you can deduce that there have been infinitely many mammals. Which turns out not to be the case.</p>
<p>The problem was identified by the Greeks, if not earlier, as the logical paradox of the heap (σωρίτης, “sorites”). Suppose:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I have a heap of sand</p></li>
<li><p>If I remove a single grain of sand from a heap, I still have a heap of sand</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From this, we can deduce that even when I’ve removed every grain of sand I will still have a heap of sand. Which seems silly. Most philosophers<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> who have considered the question say that the argument is wrong somehow.</p>
<p>There is a randomised-trial version of the sorites: “Should we randomise the last patient?”</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p> It is unethical to choose a treatment at random when there is reliable evidence as to the best treatment</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, it is unethical to conduct a randomised trial that is larger than needed to produce reliable evidence</p></li>
<li><p>Stopping the trial one person earlier won’t affect whether it produces reliable evidence</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From these principles we could deduce that randomised trials of non-zero size are never ethical.</p>
<p>While this is a coherent viewpoint, it’s an extreme one. The output of the argument seems much stronger than the inputs. The paradox of the heap is reassuring: not that it implies randomising the last patient is actually ethical, but that it supports thinking about the question in real settings rather than as an exercise in piano arithmetic.</p>
