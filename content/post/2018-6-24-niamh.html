<p>Admittedly, it’s <em>conceivable</em> for parents to make a simple error in assigning a child’s name.</p>
<p>In a fictional example from Kerry Greenwood’s <a href="http://phrynefisher.com/">‘Phryne Fisher’</a> series, the protagonist’s hungover father accidentally named her after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phryne">Phryne</a> the Greek courtesan rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid_and_Psyche">Psyche</a>. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov#Family_name_etymology">Isaac Asimov’s father</a> incorrectly transliterated the Cyrllic Азимов as ‘Asimov’ rather than ‘Azimov’.</p>
<p>By and large, though, the idea that someone is simply incorrect about their name or their child’s name falls under “not even wrong”.</p>
<p>It’s <em>conceivable</em> that there are parents who had heard of the popular Irish girl’s name pronounced [ˈniːəv] and, not realising the weirdness of Irish orthography, incorrectly thought it was spelt “Neve” rather than “Niamh”.</p>
<p>The idea that the Prime Minister of New Zealand and her partner are in this category beggars belief.</p>
