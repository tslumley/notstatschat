<p>People often ask what the difference is between <em>strata</em> and <em>clusters</em> in sampling. Here’s my current soundbite version</p>
<p><strong>Strata</strong> are a partition of the population where we hope different strata are different. We sample from all the strata in the population, so the generalisation from the sample to the population is <strong>within strata</strong> and is more accurate because of stratified sampling.</p>
<p><strong>Clusters</strong> are a partition of the population where we fear different clusters are different. We are forced to sample from just a few clusters in the population, because it’s cheaper that way. The generalisation from the sample to the population is <strong>between clusters</strong> and is less accurate because of cluster sampling.</p>
