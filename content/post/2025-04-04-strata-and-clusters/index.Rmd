People often ask what the difference is between *strata* and *clusters* in sampling. Here's my current soundbite version

**Strata** are a partition of the population where we hope different strata are different.  We sample from all the strata in the population, so the generalisation from the sample to the population is **within strata** and is more accurate because of stratified sampling.

**Clusters** are a partition of the population where we fear different clusters are different.  We are forced to sample from just a few clusters in the population, because it's cheaper that way. The generalisation from the sample to the population is **between clusters** and is less accurate because of cluster sampling.
