<p>Public Policy Polling, which is known for adding questions in surveys to exploit Republicans who are less informed, recently found that 30% of Republican voters would support bombing Agrabah, a fictional country in the Disney film Aladdin. On December 20, 2015, <a href="http://www.wparesearch.com/uncategorized/44-percent-of-democrats-support-taking-refugees-from-a-fictional-country/">WPA Research fielded</a> a national survey of 1,132 registered voters that found 44% of Democrats would support …..</p>
<p>As you know, I think the Agrabah bombing question was misleading and unhelpful to public political discourse. It’s only slightly interesting that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Perkins_Allen_Opinion_Research">Republican polling firm</a> wants to play the same trick. </p>
<p>The `bombing Agrabah’ question made a good story because on both moral and international-law grounds you shouldn’t bomb other countries unless you have a very good reason. You need to trick people into saying they want to bomb somewhere they haven’t heard of. </p>
<p>So, what can you trick lefties into saying about Agrabah? Something about taxes or gay marriage or abortion? Well, no.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the  UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Contracting States shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, according to Wilson Perkins Allen Research the scandalous opinion you can  trick 44% of Democratic-leaning into stating: they would <strong>support</strong> accepting refugees from somewhere they’ve never heard of. </p>
<p>I think someone’s got that backwards.</p>
