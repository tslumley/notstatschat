<p>One way to prove you can really keep up with the cool kids is to move your blog to GitHub the day after they get bought by Microsoft.</p>

I’m not actually worried by that: one of the key features of a git repository is that it doesn’t have the only copy of any of your stuff. The main motivation for switching was to use <code>blogdown</code> rather than Tumblr, because my blog is mostly text.</p>
<p>Converting from Tumblr was a bit of a pain, partly because the Python setup on my desktop machine is a mess, partly because there’s a lot of MathJax in the blog, and partly because I wanted to fix up the font choices in some posts. I ended up doing a lot of it by hand. It wasn’t too bad, though.</p>
