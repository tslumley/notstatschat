<p>If you have two regression models
<span class="math display">\[E[Y|X]=\beta_0+\beta_1X\]</span>
and
<span class="math display">\[E[Y|X,Z]=\gamma_0+\gamma_1X+\gamma_2Z\]</span>
then typically <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\neq\beta_1\)</span>, because they are different things<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A common name for this phenomenon is <strong>omitted-variable bias</strong>. That’s an unfortunate name, because it implies a direction in a situation that’s completely symmetric. Yes, <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> is biased for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(\hat\gamma_1\)</span> is equally biased for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The idea that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> is somehow natural and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is wrong comes from the gold-standard<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> way of thinking about regression model choice: that there is a true model defined by having all its coefficients non-zero, and that your job is to find it. From this point of view, either <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2=0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is preferred but <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1=\gamma_1\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\neq 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> is preferred.</p>
<p>If you want <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\hat\gamma_1\)</span> has <strong>included-variable bias</strong>. If you want <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\hat\beta_1\)</span> has omitted-variable bias. Or you can stop trying to think of the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> as being estimates of the same things and just talk about which one you actually want to estimate.</p>
