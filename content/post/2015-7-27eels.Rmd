_Scene: A wetland by high-country stream, Te Wai Pounamu. Rangers from Te Papa Atawhai pick up a bedraggled hunter._

“How did you get up here? Where’s your boat”

“Not a boat. Over there.” He gestures

“Yeah? So why are you out here in the swamp?”

“Can’t go back.”

“What’s the matter, bro?” asks the bigger ranger, who’s obviously been chosen as the good cop.

“They got out of the net,” the hunter said, showing his bleeding hand is missing a finger

“You mean..”

“Kī tōnu taku waka topaki i te tuna”

The smaller ranger looks blank. His colleague fills him in on the full strength.

“F-ing poachers get more careless every year. His hovercraft is full of eels.”
