*Attention Conservation Notice: these are the most popular posts, so if you cared you would already have seen them*

According to Google Analytics, these were the most popular pages on this site in 2020:

1. [What have I got against the Shapiro-Wilk test?](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2019/02/09/what-have-i-got-against-the-shapiro-wilk-test/) This 2019 post was popular because it has been linked on StackOverflow and by Hadley Wickham, which is why it's at the top.  I still think it's worth reading. 
2. [Weights in statistics](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2020/08/04/weights-in-statistics/) "There are roughly three and half distinct uses of the term *weights* in statistical methodology..."  I think this is an important post. 
3. [You will probably not be eaten by a grue](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2020/10/30/you-will-probably-not-be-eaten-by-a-grue/). I wrote an interpreter for a subset of BASIC to run the 'Oregon Trail' game.  A toy solution to a toy problem.
4. [What is 'Data Science Practice'?](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2019/12/25/what-is-data-science-practice/) Advertising for a course design. It's a good course, but the advertising is worthwhile only because the demarcation dispute is a real problem for statistics departments vs computer science.
5. [Whatâ€™s the right proof of the Continuous Mapping Theorem?](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2015/05/03/whats-the-right-proof-of-the-continuous-mapping-theorem/) From **2015?** I have no idea why this was popular. I stand by the content, but I don't see why that many people should care.
6. [When the sky didn't fall.](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2020/09/26/when-the-sky-didn-t-fall/) Political propaganda, as part of a failed NZ referendum campaign.  I'm not sure why I cared so much about the cannabis referendum. Maybe it's that legalisation is the rare policy change that seems Pareto-improving -- it doesn't affect most people, and it helps a substantial minority. The ~~lying liars who lied~~ seriously misleading advertising on the 'no' campaign also got right up my nose.
7. [Multifactor interventions and interactions.](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2020/01/09/most-multifactor-intervetions-have-interactions/) The brilliant Susan Murphy has been fighting for factorial studies in addiction and mental illness. This is absolutely a good idea. However, I've seen (including in grant proposals) people misunderstanding the FAQs on interaction and factorial design from her research group. So I wrote this.
8. [MOAR survey regression models.](https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2020/09/24/moar-survey-regression-models/) I wrapped the `VGAM` package by Other Thomas (Thomas Yee) so it would handle survey designs; this makes many more regression models available for complex survey data.

The other two pages from the top ten were the root page for the site and the *About* page.
