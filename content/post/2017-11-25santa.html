<p><em>Attention Conservation Notice: while this probability question actually came up in in real life, that’s just because I’m a nerd.</em></p>
<p>“Secret Santa” is a Christmas tradition for taming the gift-giving problem in offices, groups of acquaintances, etc. Instead of everyone wondering which subset of people they should give a gift to, each person is randomly assigned one recipient and has to give a gift (with a relatively low upper bound on cost) to that one person. The ‘Secret’ part is that you don’t know who is going to give you the gift. </p>
<p>It’s not completely trivial (though it’s not that hard) to come up with a random process that assigns everyone exactly one recipient and ensures that no-one is left finding a gift for themselves.  One procedure is to sample recipients without replacement to get a list that’s guaranteed to be one-to-one, and then just repeat the sampling until you get an allocation where no-one is assigned themselves. </p>
<p>So, a probability question: how likely is it that a random permutation will have ‘collisions’ where someone is their own Secret Santa? Or, equivalently, how many tries would you expect to need to get a working allocation? Does it depend on the number of people <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>? What about for 3600 people, as in the <a href="https://nzsecretsanta.nzpost.co.nz/">scheme</a> hosted by NZ Post on Twitter.  </p>
<p>I knew the answer, but I didn’t know a proof, so this is a reasonably honest exploration of how you might find the answer.</p>
<p>First, is there some simple bound? Well, the chance that you, Dear Reader, get assigned yourself is <span class="math inline">\(1/n\)</span>, so the simple Bonferroni bound is <span class="math inline">\(n\times 1/n\)</span>. That doesn’t look very helpful, because we already knew 1 was an upper bound; this is a probability.  However, we  can recast the Bonferroni bound as the <strong>expected number</strong> of collisions.  If the expected number of collisions is 1, then it’s reasonable to expect that the probability of no collisions is appreciable, and that as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases it converges to some useful number that isn’t 1 or 0.  At this point, if you had to make a wild guess, a reasonable guess would be that the number of collisions has approximately a Poisson distribution for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, so that the probability of no collisions will be approximately <span class="math inline">\(e^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, try simulation. Doing <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> replicates in R gives</p>

</div>
<p>The probability is 1 if you try to do this by yourself, 1/2 if you have one friend, and converges astonishingly quickly to a fixed value.  The red line is <span class="math inline">\(1-e^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, can we prove this? The collisions aren’t independent, so we can’t quite just use a Poisson or Binomial argument. We could try the higher-order Bonferroni bounds, eg<br />
<span class="math display">\[P(\cup\_i A\_i)\geq \sum\_i P(A\_i) - \sum_{i,j} P(A\_i\cap A\_j).\]</span></p>
<p>The second-order bound gives <span class="math inline">\(n\times 1/n-{n\choose 2}\times 1/n^2=1/2\)</span>, so we’re making progress.  The third-order bound gives<br />
<span class="math display">\[n\times 1/n-{n\choose 2}\times 1/n^2+{n\choose 3}\times 1/n^3=1-1/2+1/6=4/6\]</span></p>
<p>We’re definitely making progress now, and these bounds look suspiciously like the values of the probability for <span class="math inline">\(n=1,\,2,\,3\)</span>.  Continuing the pattern, we will end up with<br />
<span class="math display">\[\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}{n\choose k} n^{-k}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{n^{-k}}\]</span></p>
<p>Comparing that to the infinite series for <span class="math inline">\(\exp(x)\)</span>, it’s <span class="math inline">\(1-e^{-1}\)</span>. What we haven’t got this way is whether the number of collisions is Poisson, which was where the guess originally came from. This seems to be a lot harder.  </p>
<p>First, simulation confirms that the Poisson <strong>is</strong> a good approximation. That’s reassuring: it’s typically easier to prove things that are true than things that are not true. </p>
<p>I should next say that I spent quite a long time looking for ‘coupling’ arguments to show that this assignment method gave the same large-sample distribution as some other assignment method that was obviously Poisson. I didn’t get anywhere with this, but it’s a fruitful approach for problems similar to this one. Since that didn’t work, we’re back to combinatorics.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we have 1 collision. That means we have an assignment of the <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> other people with no collisions. So, the number of ways to have 1 collision in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times the number of ways to have no collisions in <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> people. Since the number of permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people is also <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times the number of permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> people, the fraction of permutations with 1 collision in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people is the same as the fraction of permutations with 0 collisions in <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> people, ie, for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> it’s <span class="math inline">\(e^{-1}\)</span>. That agrees with the Poisson formula, so we’re definitely making progress.</p>
<p>If we have <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> collisions in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people then we have a set of <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> people with no collisions. The number of ways we can have <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> people with no collisions is about <span class="math inline">\((n-k)!e^{-1}\)</span> and the number of ways to pick the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people who have to buy themselves gifts is <span class="math inline">\({n\choose k}= n!/(k!(n-k)!)\)</span>. So, the number of ways of having <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> collisions in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is about <span class="math inline">\(n!e^{-1}/k!\)</span>, and the probability of this is <span class="math inline">\(e^{-1}/k!\)</span>, matching the Poisson distribution. We’ve done it!</p>
<p>Ok. Technically we’re not quite done, since we’d need to show the approximation error in the argument actually gets smaller with increasing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. But we’re done enough for me. </p>
<p>PS: If you want an easy way <strong>not</strong> to have to worry about collisions, just arrange the people in random order and assign each person the following person in the list (with the last person being assigned the first).</p>
