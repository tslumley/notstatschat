<p>There was a story at the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/health-wellbeing/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501238&amp;objectid=11596733">New Zealand Herald</a>, republished without attribution from <a href="https://theconversation.com/people-in-their-nineties-reveal-the-secrets-to-ageing-well-52237">TheConversation</a>, under the headline <strong>“People in their 90s reveal secret to ageing well”</strong>.  </p>
<p>By and large, it’s pretty good example of what The Conversation is trying to do, but there are some strange bits, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regular exercise changes our epigenome, activating genes that improve muscle function </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Few participants smoked, avoiding the known epigenetic effects of cigarette smoke including lung damage, increased risk of dementia and cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first is basically true, but “Regular exercise improves muscle function” seems more natural and is much more strongly supported by research. For smoking it’s even worse: it’s well established that some of the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke are mutagenic rather than epigenetic. </p>
<p>In something that’s supposed to be about healthy ageing, phrasing everything in terms of epigenetics makes it sound more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_McClure">Troy Maclure</a> video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might remember me from posts such as “Genomics: salvation of millions”, “Interferon: Take that, viruses”, and “Humours: Are yours balanced?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exercise, a good diet, and not smoking are excellent strategies for a long and healthy life, but almost none of the supporting evidence comes from epigenomics, even though that makes it sound more sciencey</p>
