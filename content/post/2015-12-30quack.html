<p>Because reasons, I ended up looking at a website for a new superfood,  <a href="https://www.konared.com/the-hawaiian-coffeeberry/">“The Hawaiian Coffeeberry ®”</a>.  ““The Hawaiian Coffeeberry ®”, of course, isn’t a Hawaiian plant – it’s coffee, orginally from Ethiopia – but at least the marketing is Hawaiian. Well, the parts that aren’t unsourced copying from various internet sites.</p>
<p>Here’s a description of what they think the dominant nutrients are:</p>

<p>The chlorogenic acid bit is ok, though they don’t mention it’s also found in, eg, peaches, and eggplant, and potatoes. </p>
<p>For quinic acid, the first sentence is repeated verbatim at <a href="http://www.coffeechemistry.com/chemistry/acids">coffeechemistry.com</a>. More importantly, the second sentence is a warped version of Wikipedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This acid is a versatile chiral starting material for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals. A medication for the treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" title="Influenza">influenza A</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" title="Influenza">B</a> strains called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamiflu" title="Tamiflu">Tamiflu</a> has been successfully developed and launched into the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is pretty clear which is the original: the Wikipedia claim about Tamiflu is true (quinic acid was a starting material) and the “The Hawaiian Coffeeberry ®” claim is false (quinic acid is <strong>not</strong> marketed as Tamiflu).</p>
<p>For the third ‘nutrient’, the second spelling “ferulic acid” is the correct one. The second sentence is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferulic_acid#In_food">very close match</a> to Wikipedia. What’s really interesting is the first sentence, with the numbers that look like references but aren’t. Teachers will recognise free-floating reference markers as a sign of plagiarism. Teachers will also know the Google reveals all (or at least ‘most’). </p>
<p>There are a <a href="http://www.digood.com/product/c/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWRlLWluLWNoaW5hLmNvbS9zaG93cm9vbS9sZWFkZXJjaGVtZ3JvdXAvcHJvZHVjdC1kZXRhaWxpZVdKdkt0eG5acHcvQ2hpbmEtRmVydWxpYy1BY2lkLUNBUy1Oby0xMTM1LTI0LTYtRmFjdG9yeS5odG1s.html">few</a> places where the phrase “contributes to the antibacterial <span class="math display">\[1\]</span> and antioxidant <span class="math display">\[2\]</span> properties” appears. In those places, the full sentence is</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “It is one of the phenolic compounds found in the invasive plant species carpobrotus edulis and contributes to the antibacterial<span class="math display">\[1\]</span> and antioxidant<span class="math display">\[2\]</span> properties of the plant.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Searching on that sentence gives a Wikipedia entry, but for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutin#Occurrences">rutin</a>, not for ferulic acid. </p>
<p>Fail. </p>
