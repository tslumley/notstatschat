DNA looks like a zipper.  

If you scale it up to a fairly fine-toothed zipper with tooth spacing of about 2mm or 1/12in, the human genome would run about from Auckland to Hawai’i.

On this scale, 1 Morgan is about 230km, so you inherit contiguous genome chunks from your grandparents of about 60km. 

The HLA region is about 6km long.

A million-variant SNPchip has markers spaced several meters apart.

A typical gene is maybe 20 meters from start to finish, but a lot of it is introns, and most exons are less than half a meter long.

And, on this scale, the original Human Genome Project cost rather less per mile than a rural two-lane road.
