<p><em>Scene: A wetland by high-country stream, Te Wai Pounamu. Rangers from Te Papa Atawhai pick up a bedraggled hunter.</em></p>
<p>“How did you get up here? Where’s your boat”</p>
<p>“Not a boat. Over there.” He gestures</p>
<p>“Yeah? So why are you out here in the swamp?”</p>
<p>“Can’t go back.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, bro?” asks the bigger ranger, who’s obviously been chosen as the good cop.</p>
<p>“They got out of the net,” the hunter said, showing his bleeding hand is missing a finger</p>
<p>“You mean..”</p>
<p>“Kī tōnu taku waka topaki i te tuna”</p>
<p>The smaller ranger looks blank. His colleague fills him in on the full strength.</p>
<p>“F-ing poachers get more careless every year. His hovercraft is full of eels.”</p>
