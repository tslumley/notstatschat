<p>In response to the question “How much science knowledge should the average person have or should we just encourage people to ask questions?”</p>

<p>Expanding on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atoms: everything is made of a very large but not infinite number of definite, basically indivisible, pieces, and there are very few different types (about 100).</li>
<li>Evolution: Complex goal-oriented behaviour in the world mostly came by repeated competition to choose the best-performing of a random set of variations. That’s how life developed from single cells: it isn’t necessary to have intelligent choice or design. </li>
<li>“the lights in the sky are suns”. The stars are the same kind of thing as the sun, but very, very far away, so they appear tiny.</li>
<li>Randomisation: The only really reliable way to get a fair comparison between two strategies is random choice of strategy for a large enough set of examples</li>
<li>Conservation laws: Many important facts about physics are in the for “the amount of X doesn’t change”, where X might be energy or mass or momentum or spin or charge. There are deep mathematical reasons for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, above all, the question “Why do you believe this?” is always in order. </p>
