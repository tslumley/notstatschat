<p><em>Background: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/05/17/revenge_ego_and_the_corruption_of_wikipedia/">Revenge, ego, and corruption in Wikipedia</a></em></p>
<p>Today we have shaming of prats. Yesterday, <br />
we had unclear sources, and tomorrow morning<br />
we may have original research. But today, <br />
Today we have shaming of prats. <em>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_robin">Flame Robin</a> </em><br />
<em>is a small passerine bird native to Australia</em>,<br />
and today we have shaming of prats</p>
<p>This is the anonymous editor. And this<br />
is the revenge edit, whose use you will see<br />
when you are snubbed by an author.<br />
And this is the appeals process.<br />
Which in your case you have not got. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_XI"><em>Final Fantasy XI</em></a><br />
<em>is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, </em><br />
which in my case I do not get.     </p>
<p>This is the revision process, which maintains<br />
the history of each page. And please do not let me<br />
 catch any user editing his own page. It is perfectly easy<br />
 if you sign in as a different user. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Journey">A Journey</a> <br />
</em> <em>is a 2010 memoir by Tony Blair</em> <em>discussing <br />
</em> <em>his tenure as leader of the British Labour Party.<br />
</em> You wouldn’t catch him editing his own pages.</p>
<p>And this you can see is the talk page. The purpose of this<br />
is to clear the air, as you see. We can argue<br />
rapidly backwards and forwards: we say this <br />
raises the standards. <em>When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriflamme#Significance_on_the_battlefield">the Oriflamme</a> was </em><br />
<em>displayed on the battlefield it indicated<br />
that no quarter was to be given</em>. <br />
They called this raising the standard.</p>
<p>They call it raising the standard: it is perfectly easy <br />
if you sign in as a different user: like the revenge edit, <br />
and the anonymous editor, and the appeals process <br />
(which in our case we have not got), and the massive<br />
online role-playing games, and the Oriflamme<br />
displayed on the battlefield, for today<br />
we have shaming of prats.</p>
