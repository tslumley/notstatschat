<p>Today, Jeroen Ooms announced the appearance on CRAN of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=cld2">an R package for language detection</a>, wrapping the “<a href="https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2">CLD2</a>″ compact language detector.   Obviously, given a tool like that on a holiday long weekend, my first reaction was to try to confuse it.</p>
<p>Two fun games to play with a language detector:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find an obviously English sentence (ideally a quote) that it doesn’t recognise as English, and a very non-obviously English sentence that it does</p></li>
<li><p>Find two sentences with as few differences as possible, where one is recognised as English and the other not</p></li>
</ul>
<p>CLD2 doesn’t recognise the famous telegram about platypuses “Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic” as English, which I suppose is fair enough. </p>
<p>It didn’t recognise Getrude Stein’s “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose”, or even the shorter “Rose is a rose is a rose”, though it had no trouble with the start of FInnegan’s “Finnegans Wake” or bits of “Howl”.  Even better than the Stein, though:</p>

<p>There’s a linguistic discussion of this sort of sentence <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005101.html">at Language Log</a> -- it’s not usual English in a lot of ways –  but I think it’s going to be hard to beat as a false negative.</p>
<p>As a false positive I tried Jabberwocky (English), and then thought of Douglas Hofstatder’s self-referential example sentences</p>

<p>Ok, so how far can the second one be warped and still show up as English?</p>

<p>That’s English, but “See Spot run” isn’t!</p>
<p>For minimal changes: changing “a” to “the”</p>

<p>And as a sort of combination of the two: Chomsky’s obviously-English nonsense sentence “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” is recognised as English, but so is every permutation of the same words. </p>
<p>So, is there a point to this (other than a fun way to waste half an hour)? Well, one of the important things to remember about automated classification algorithms is (as Zeynep Tukfeci puts it) <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_machine_intelligence_makes_human_morals_more_important">how alien they are</a>. They can often imitate human decisions astonishingly well, but they don’t work the same way.  If another person makes the same decisions as you, it’s a good bet there are some basically similar reasons underneath. It’s easy to believe the same is true for machines, but it isn’t.</p>
