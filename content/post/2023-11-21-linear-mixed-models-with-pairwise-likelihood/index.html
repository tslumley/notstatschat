<p>The most important part of this post</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(svylme)</code></pre>
<p>It exists!</p>
<p>Currently you have to get it from github</p>
<pre><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;tslumley/svylme&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at an example. This is data from the New Zealand component of the PISA educational survey</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(nzmaths)</code></pre>
<p>There is only one school in one of the strata, so we’ll combine two strata:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nzmaths$cSTRATUM&lt;- nzmaths$STRATUM
nzmaths$cSTRATUM[nzmaths$cSTRATUM==&quot;NZL0102&quot;]&lt;-&quot;NZL0202&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We have weights both for the student and the school; the <code>condwt</code> variable is the implied weights for the student stage of sampling. We get a two-stage design with weights at both stages. We need weights at both stages in order to work out the pairwise weights</p>
<pre class="r"><code>des&lt;-svydesign(id=~SCHOOLID+STIDSTD, strata=~cSTRATUM, nest=TRUE,
	weights=~W_FSCHWT+condwt, data=nzmaths)</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>PCGIRLS</code> is percentage of girls at the school, and it’s nearly 0, nearly 100%, or roughly in the middle, so I will centre it. We’re also going to want jackknife weights later, so we can make them now</p>
<pre class="r"><code>des&lt;-update(des, centPCGIRLS=PCGIRLS-0.5)
jkdes&lt;-as.svrepdesign(des)</code></pre>
<p>And finally, a model</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1&lt;-svy2lme(PV1MATH~ (1+ ST04Q01 |SCHOOLID)+ST04Q01*(centPCGIRLS+SMRATIO)+MATHEFF+OPENPS, design=des, return.devfun=TRUE)
m1</code></pre>

<p>The model has student gender, proportion of girls at the school, their interaction, student/teacher ratio in mathematics, and the two attitude scores. The scores measure openness to problem solving (‘I can solve problems’) and mathematics self-efficacy (‘I can learn maths’).</p>
<p>The interpretation of the individual/school gender interaction may not be immediately obvious: it says that both boys and girls had higher average scores at single-sex than coeducational schools. We should be cautious about interpreting this causally, as single-sex schools in New Zealand differ from coeducational schools in so many other ways as well.</p>
<p>To get standard errors for the variance parameters we need to use the jackknife or bootstrap. This is a bit slow (there’s a progress bar for interactive use, which I will turn off). Using a faster-than-default BLAS for linear algebra will help.</p>

<p>The jackknife SEs for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are slightly larger than the sandwich ones, which shouldn’t surprise anyone. The SEs for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are a bit hard to interpret, because <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are a bit hard to interpret – they are components of the Cholesky square root of the relative variance matrix.</p>
<p>More usefully, here are the standard errors for the random-effect standard deviations</p>

<h3>Issues?</h3>
<p><strong>What if you don’t have weights at each stage?</strong> The answer is currently unclear. More research is needed on ways to approximate the pairwise probabilities when they are not known</p>
<p><strong>How does this compare to using <code>-gllamm-</code> and its successors, like sensible people do?</strong> It’s pretty similar, but this approach can handle a much wider range of designs and models – you don’t need the model clusters and design clusters to be the same. More systematic comparisons <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04944">here</a>: there’s some loss of efficiency with pairwise likelihood, but the estimates stay reasonable under more extreme sampling designs.</p>
<p><strong>What about generalised linear mixed models?</strong> That sounds like a good PhD project!</p>
