<p>“Filtering for rare variant tests”  CHARGE consortium workshop, Rotterdam.  Basic message: it’s total count of rare alleles that matters.</p>
<p>“R: an environment for statistical computing and graphics”.  CWI, Amsterdam.  Talking about the history, design, and applications of R to a scary computer-science audience.</p>
<p>“Testing rare DNA variants in unrelated individuals: experience from the CHARGE consortium”, IARC, Lyon.  On unidirectional and omnidirectional ‘burden of mutation’ tests using rare DNA variants.</p>
<p>“Analysing very large surveys with SQL generated from R” ITACOSM conference, Milan.  Message: use <a href="http://www.monetdb.org/">MonetDB</a> for the big-data parts, controlled from R, which handles the complicated parts. </p>
<p>“Information criteria under complex sampling” ITACOSM conference, Milan.  How to construct analogues of AIC and BIC for complex survey samples.  Yes, I am aware this could be characterised as filling a much-needed gap. </p>
